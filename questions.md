1. The only thing left broken is the fact that it prints nothing. Its kind of important but I cannot find a solution
anywhere. I patiently await an answer on stack overflow
2. I havent really had any spare time to add anything extravagant to my program. At the most I would say that my program 
when printing a dealers hand or a players hand can print them on seperate rows just based on the row integer you give it
3. Classes are used to make a complicated program by storing information in a compiled area then having the ability
to take that specific object data.
4. A public class, method, variable, object can be accessed by any other class. A private class, method, variable or object cannot be accessed by another class. With private variables you have to use setters and getters.
5. An instance level variable is only accessible by a certain method, a for loop, if statement etc. A class level variable is accessible by anything in that class and if the class is public, any other class.
6. Inheritance like how I used player is helpful to avoid rewriting code if two things share something. If I wanted to keep a tally of every single animal I could simply have an animal class and then have them all have different genus's etc.
7. When you use the keyword "this" you are reffering to the current class that keyword is in. When you say super() your calling your parent class.
8. Every object must have state and behavior to be considered an object.
9. A lot of the syntax is still pretty confusing and I wish I knew why the things we are learning work the way they do.
